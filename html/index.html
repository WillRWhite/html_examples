        Here is a regular button which responds with "Hello World" from the page:
        <div>
            <button type="button" onclick="alert('Hello world!')">

            <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('return_date_time').innerHTML=Date()">
                Click me to display Date and Time
            </button>
            <p id='return_date_time'> 
            </p>
        </div>
    </p>

            And yet another button
            <div>
                <button type="button" onclick="document.innerHTML=print()">
                    Print Page
               </button>
            </div>           
    <p>
        .... and now we have a new paragraph. I wonder what this will do. Maybe just start a new pararagrapn.
